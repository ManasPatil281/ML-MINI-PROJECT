## üéØ Project Overview

### What is Superconductivity?

Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where certain materials can conduct electricity with **zero electrical resistance** when cooled below a critical temperature (Tc). This breakthrough property enables:

- **Zero energy loss** in power transmission
- **Powerful electromagnets** for MRI machines and particle accelerators
- **Quantum computing** applications
- **Maglev transportation** systems

### Project Goals

This project applies **9 different machine learning algorithms** to:

1. **Predict** the critical temperature (Tc) of superconducting materials
2. **Classify** materials as HIGH-Tc or LOW-Tc superconductors
3. **Discover** hidden patterns and material families through clustering
4. **Reduce** dimensionality to identify the most important material properties
5. **Compare** model performance to select optimal algorithms

### Why This Matters

Traditional superconductor discovery involves:
- **Years** of laboratory experiments
- **$500K-$1M** in R&D costs per material
- **Trial-and-error** synthesis and testing

**Machine Learning accelerates this by:**
- Predicting properties in **seconds** instead of years
- Reducing experimental costs by **60-70%**
- Identifying promising candidates from millions of possibilities
- Guiding researchers to the most promising materials
